Black-browed Albatross survival from Steeple Jason

Analysis requested by Andy Stanworth from Falklands Conservation to estimate adult survival probability for a small monitoring colony of Black-browed Albatrosses within the huge (>200.000 pairs) Steeple Jason colony. Due to the erratic delineation of the study plot there were a large number of birds that were never recaptured, and these birds were eventually excluded (survival was way too low if these birds were included). No attempt to account for emigration or transients.
